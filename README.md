Medication is the art of curing or preventing illness. The evolution of modern medicine represents a tremendous positive change in the approach to treating illness and disease. The rise of modern medicine has contributed immensely towards identifying the procedures to treat several diseases and prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Most medicines are prepared and targeted towards an average individual suffering the illness and are recently perceived as an ineffective process to treat an individual. Medication errors are equally recurrent in general practice which harms the patient and creates an unsafe treating environment. However, current technologies are enhancing the field of precision medicines which targets the individualized treatment based on genetic, phenotypic, biomarker, or psychosocial characteristics. (Jameson, 2015) Every drug uniquely interacts with each human body, so what works well for one individual may not help the another. Precision medicines are often referred to as the future of healthcare as it aims to tailor the medication as per the condition of the individual. According to “Trends in Precision Medicine Adoption” report by Oracle states (Issa, 2014) a majority of healthcare organizations in the world have planned to actively participate in precision medicine studies and invest on developing the technology in the next two years.
